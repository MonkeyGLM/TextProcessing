Documentation:
The code is fairly documented as it has comments explaining what certain parts of the code does. However it could include a README file. It's fine as it is but it can use more work if required. If so, it could use more frequent comments and a README file.

Error Handling:
The code has some error handling by checking if the file exists before trying to read it, which is good. However, it doesn’t handle other possible errors, like if the file is unreadable, so it needs more work. It could be improved by adding error checks when reading the file or processing its contents.

Naming:
The code uses descriptive variable names like filePath, lines, and wordCounts, which makes it easier to understand.

Code Structure:
The code is structured with everything inside the Main method, so it needs more work. It should split different parts into seperate functions to make it easier to understand.

File Assumptions:
The code checks if the file exists before reading, which prevents crashes from errors, but it assumes that the file is readalbe and its contents are correct, so it needs more work. It could add checks for this to prevent any issues.

OOP Principles:
The code doesn’t use object-oriented principles, which needs more work. It could use classes help separate tasks and make the design more reusable, a similar solution to code structure.

Output:
The code outputs the word counts in alphabetical order, which is clear and easy to read.

Program Logic:
The codes program logic works well, doing all of the things it's supposed to do, with some checks for things that could cause exceptions, yet it has a fairly poor code structure.
